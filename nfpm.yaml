# Version Prerelease.
# Default is extracted from `version` if it is semver compatible.
# This is appended to the `version`, e.g. `1.2.3+beta1`. If the `version` is
# semver compatible, then this replaces the prerelease component of the semver.

# Version Metadata (previously deb.metadata).
# Default is extracted from `version` if it is semver compatible.
# Setting metadata might interfere with version comparisons depending on the
# packager. If the `version` is semver compatible, then this replaces the
# version metadata component of the semver.
# version_metadata: git

# Version Release, aka revision.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. release: ${VERSION_RELEASE}
# This is appended to the `version` after `prerelease`. This should be
# incremented if you release an updated package of the same upstream version,
# and it should reset to 1 when bumping the version.
